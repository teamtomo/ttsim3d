## Installation

`ttsim3d` is available on PyPi and can be installed via

```zsh
pip install ttsim3d
```

### From source
To create a source installation, first download/clone the repository, then run the install command
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/teamtomo/ttsim3d.git
cd ttsim3d

## Running CLI program

Installation of the package creates the executable program `ttsim3d-cli` which takes in a PDB file along with other simulation options and outputs the simulated 3D scattering potential to a .mrc file. 
All options for the program can be printed by running:
```zsh
ttsim3d-cli --help
```

<!-- The following are descriptions of each of the options for the program

## Python objects

There are two user-facing classes in `ttsim3d` built upon Pydantic models for validating inputs and simulating a volume.
The first class, `ttsim3d.models.Simulator`, holds reference to a PDB file and basic simulation parameters related to that structure.
The second class, `ttsim3d.models.SimulatorConfig` is used to configure more advanced options, such as dose weighting and simulation upsampling.
An basic use of these objects to run a simulation looks like
```python
from ttsim3d.models import Simulator, SimulatorConfig

# Instantiate the configuration object 
sim_conf = SimulatorConfig(
    voltage=300.0,  # in keV
    apply_dose_weighting=True,
    dose_start=0.0,  # in e-/A^2
    dose_end=35.0,   # in e-/A^2
    upsampling=-1,   # auto
)

# Instantiate the simulator
sim = Simulator(
    pdb_filepath="some/path/to/structure.pdb",
    pixel_spacing=1.25,  # Angstroms
    volume_shape=(256, 256, 256),
    b_factor_scaling=1.0,
    additional_b_factor=15.0,  # Add to all atoms
    simulator_config=sim_conf,
)

# Run the simulation
volume = sim.run()
print(type(volume))  # torch.Tensor
print(volume.shape)  # (256, 256, 256)

# OR export the simulation to a mrc file
mrc_filepath = "some/path/to/simulated_structure/mrc"
sim.export_to_mrc(mrc_filepath)
```

### Running on GPU or CPU

The `ttsim3d` package supports GPU accelerated simulations with PyTorch.
Use the `device` argument to specify which device to run the simulation on.

```python
# ...
# Assume same objects as above

# Run on the CPU
volume_cpu = sim.run(device="cpu")

# Run on the GPU (assumes CUDA is available)
# Both run on the zeroth GPU device
volume_gpu = sim.run(device="0")
volume_gpu = sim.run(device="cuda:0")

# Same argument can be passed to the `export_to_mrc` method
sim.export_to_mrc(mrc_filepath, device="cuda:0")
```

### Working with configuration files

Simulation configurations can be saved to disk as either a YAML or JSON file by using the `to_yaml` or `to_json` methods of the `Simulator` class, respectively.
Assuming the same `sim` object defined as above, you can export the configuration to a YAML file like this:
```python
sim.to_yaml("some/path/to/simulation_config.yaml")
```

The contents of the YAML file will look something like this:
```yaml
additional_b_factor: 15.0
b_factor_scaling: 1.0
center_atoms: true
pdb_filepath: some/path/to/structure.pdb
pixel_spacing: 1.25
remove_hydrogens: true
volume_shape:
- 256
- 256
- 256
simulator_config:
  apply_dose_weighting: true
  apply_dqe: true
  atom_batch_size: 16384
  crit_exposure_bfactor: -1
  dose_end: 35.0
  dose_filter_modify_signal: None
  dose_start: 0.0
  mtf_reference: k2_300kv
  store_volume: true
  upsampling: -1
  voltage: 300.0
```

Similarly, you can load in a configuration from a YAML file by using the `from_yaml` class method of the `Simulator` class:
```python
from ttsim3d.models import Simulator

sim = Simulator.from_yaml("some/path/to/simulation_config.yaml")
```

## Included MTF reference files

Users can specify MTF reference by a path to a star file under the `SimulatorConfig.mtf_reference` parameter.
Applying a DQE filter during simulation can be turned on or off by the `SimulatorConfig.apply_dqe` parameter.

The `ttsim3d` package includes several common MTF reference files which are accessible by a string rather than a path.
To see the list of included MTF reference files, run the following code snippet:

```python
from ttsim3d import models

print(models.included_mtf_references())
```

The default MTF reference is `"k2_300kV"`, which corresponds to the MTF of a Gatan K2 camera at 300 kV.
